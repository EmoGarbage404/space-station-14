bounty-description-tooth-space-carp = We need you to get a sample of some space carp teeth. You can find these guys on all kinds of salvage debris. Just be careful about their bite.
bounty-description-tooth-sharkminnow = We need you to get a sample of some Sharkminnow teeth. These guys are a fair bit nastier than the smaller carp you're familiar with. Take care to not let them bit you: they'll suck out your blood and heal.
bounty-description-remains = We need you to get a sample of a few Hivelord cores. Be aware that Hivelords can replicate infinitely if the core is not destroyed. Take care not to get overwhelmed.
bounty-description-plates = We need you to get a couple sheets of Goliath hide. These guys are pretty slow, but be careful about the tentacles: they'll grab you and pull you to the ground. You don't want to know what happens next.
